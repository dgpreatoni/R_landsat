# R_landsat
R scripts to calculate NDVI-like indices on satellite imagery

## Usage
Main script is <tt>calculate_LANDSAT_indices.R</tt>.
Note that some scripts <tt>source</tt> the <tt>raster_utilities.R</tt> script, that can be found in the [r-misc](https://github.com/dgpreatoni/R-misc) github repository.

Automated download and processing of satellite scenery now is possible thanks to the [/16EAGLE/getSpatialData] package.
See <tt>get_imagery.R</tt> as a proof-of-concept.
